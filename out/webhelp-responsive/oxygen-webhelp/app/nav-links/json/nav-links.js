By indexing this data, you gain information about unstructured data such as file size, file data types, file owners. The data server pushes the information about volumes and indexes to the gateway so it can be communicated to the application stack. Multiple data servers feed into a single gateway. Data servers can be categorized in two types: DataServer - Classic and DataServer - Distributed. A data server of the type DataServer - Classic uses the embedded PostgreSQL database for storing the index. With a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed, the index is stored in an Elasticsearch cluster. Data servers of this type also provide better performance in search queries. They can manage much larger amounts of data than data servers of the type DataServer - Classic, thus making the IBM StoredIQ deployments more scalable. You can have both types of data servers in your IBM StoredIQ deployment. In addition to completing standard administrative tasks, administrators can deploy the IBM StoredIQ Desktop Data Collector and index desktops from the data server.\"><dfn class=\"term abbreviated-form\">Data servers</dfn></a>, and optionally the <a href=\"glossary\/elasticsearch_cluster.html\" title=\"The Elasticsearch cluster attached to a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed provides a single data store for all metadata and content of harvested objects. Indexed data is distributed automatically across the nodes in the cluster. Indexing and queries are load-balanced across all nodes. Nodes can be added dynamically without downtime and the indexing process can use these newly added nodes without further setup.\"><dfn class=\"term abbreviated-form\">Elasticsearch cluster</dfn></a>.</p>","href":"ibm_storediq_components.html","attributes": {"data-id":"ibm_storediq_components",},"menu": {"hasChildren":true,},"tocID":"ibm_storediq_components-d62e315","next":"ibm_storediq_components-d62e315",},{"title":"Planning for deployment","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">When you plan a deployment of IBM StoredIQ, evaluate several infrastructure         considerations. </p>","href":"planning_for_deployment_0.html","attributes": {"data-id":"planning_for_deployment_0",},"menu": {"hasChildren":true,},"tocID":"planning_for_deployment_0-d62e857","next":"planning_for_deployment_0-d62e857",},{"title":"Deploying IBM StoredIQ","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">IBM StoredIQ is a virtual appliance that you deploy and configure in a VMWare virtual         host environment. </p>","href":"deploying_ibm_storediq.html","attributes": {"data-id":"deploying_ibm_storediq",},"menu": {"hasChildren":true,},"tocID":"deploying_ibm_storediq-d62e1333","next":"deploying_ibm_storediq-d62e1333",},{"title":"Glossary","href":"glossary.html#application_stack","menu": {"hasChildren":true,},"tocID":"tocId-d62e1404","next":"tocId-d62e1404",}]});
