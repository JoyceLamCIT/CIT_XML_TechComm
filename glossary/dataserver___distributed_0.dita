    <glossterm>DataServer - Distributed</glossterm>
    <glossdef>The distributed data server uses an Elasticsearch cluster instead of an embedded
        Postgres database. It increases the scalability and flexibility of the IBM StoredIQ
        deployment in a way that it can manage much larger amounts of data. Without adding more data
        servers, data that is managed by the IBM StoredIQ deployment can be increased by adding new
        nodes to the Elasticsearch cluster. Search queries perform better on DataServer -
        Distributed. </glossdef>
