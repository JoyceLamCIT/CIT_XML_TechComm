        <p>Cartridges are compressed files that contain analysis logic. When you add a cartridge to
            IBM StoredIQ AppStack, it can detect new data in documents during indexing and make
            these new insights searchable. For example, a sensitive pattern cartridge can enable IBM
            StoredIQ to detect passport numbers, phone numbers, and other IDs.</p>
        <p>To apply the analysis logic contained in the cartridge, you must run a Step-up Analytics
            action that uses the cartridge on an infoset. IBM StoredIQ examines all documents in the
            infoset, applies the analytics, and then stores the analysis results in the IBM StoredIQ
            index.</p>
