    <glossdef>Automated document categorization, what IBM StoredIQ refers to as utoI classification
        models, integrates the IBMÂ® Content Classification's classification model into the IBM
        StoredIQ infoset-generation process. Data Experts can use IBM Content Classification to
        train a classification model, which is then registered with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The
        registered classification model can be applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data
        Workbench to generate new metadata for the objects in the infoset. Metadata can be used in
        rule-based filters to create new infosets.</glossdef>
