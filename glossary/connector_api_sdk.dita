    <glossdef>A connector is a software component of IBM StoredIQ that is used to connect to a data
        source such as a network file system and access its data. Using IBM StoredIQ Connector API
        SDK, developers of other companies can develop connectors to new data sources outside the
        IBM StoredIQ development environment. These connectors can be integrated with a live IBM
        StoredIQ application to index, search, manage, and analyze data on the data
        source.</glossdef>
