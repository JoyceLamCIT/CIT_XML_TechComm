Data servers can be categorized in two types: DataServer - Classic and DataServer - Distributed. A data server of the type DataServer - Classic uses the embedded PostgreSQL database for storing the index. With a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed, the index is stored in an Elasticsearch cluster. Data servers of this type also provide better performance in search queries. They can manage much larger amounts of data than data servers of the type DataServer - Classic, thus making the IBM StoredIQ deployments more scalable.
